        <H3>Using <tt>git(1)</tt></H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>
        Learning to use a code revision system and collaborating with
        others is an important aspect of programming.  <a
        href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a popular free and open
        source distributed version control system and well worth knowing
        at least the fundamental of.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note: <tt>git(1)</tt> can be used without and independent of <a
        href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>!  In this class, we will use
        <tt>git(1)</tt> on <tt>cs631apue.netmeister.org</tt> for your
        final project.

<!--
        <h4>Unix groups</h4>
        <p>
        In order to be able to share a repository hosted on
        <tt>cs631apue.netmeister.org</tt>, all your team members need to
        be in a shared Unix group.  This group needs to be created by the
        system administrators.  To have this group created, send an email
        to <a href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
        telling me the name of your team as well as the usernames of all
        your team's members.  The earlier you do this, the better.
        </p>
-->
        <h4>Accessing the repository</h4>
        <p>
        Your instructor will set up the repository for your group.  You
        will then access the repository via <tt>ssh(1)</tt> under the path
        <tt>cs631apue.netmeister.org:/usr/local/apue/$team</tt> (where
        <tt>$team</tt> is the name of your team).
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, if your username on <tt>cs631apue.netmeister.org</tt>
        was 'jdoe' and you were a member of the team 'hyper', you would
        check out the repository using the following commands:
        <blockquote><tt><pre>$ git clone jdoe@cs631apue.netmeister.org:/usr/local/apue/hyper</pre></tt></blockquote>
        </p>
        <h4>Working with git</h4>
        <p>
        You should make it a habit to begin your working session by
        updating your copy of the repository and ending it by committing
        your changes.  If you are ready to push your changes to make them
        available to your team mates, you would then push them to the
        repository:
        <blockquote><tt><pre>$ cd hyper
$ git pull
$ $EDITOR http.c
[edit, debug]
$ git commit
$ git push</pre></tt></blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
