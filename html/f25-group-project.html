        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Group Project</H2>

        <H3>Group Project: Write a simple web server</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>The objective of this assignment is for you to write a simple
	web server that speaks a limited version of HTTP/1.0 as defined in
	<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945.html">RFC1945</a>.  This
	gives you occasion to understand the process of reading an RFC and
	implementing a well-known protocol.
	</p>
	<p>You will implement the
	<tt>sws(1)</tt> command as described in the manual page provided
	to you <a href="sws.1.pdf">here</a>.  Some of
	the invocations / requests your program must be able to handle
	are <a href="test-sws.sh">shown here</a>; you
	can create directories to test your server against
	using <a href="make-swsdirs">this script</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	As usual, the <a href="hw">general homework guidelines</a> apply.
	</p>
	<p>
	This is a non-trivial programming assignment -- do not postpone
	starting to work on this!  Try to first get the basics right, then
	add functionality one by one, always ensuring that the added code
	did not break any previous functionality.  If you're stuck, describe
	your problem on the mailing list.
	</p>
        <h5>Team work</h5>
        <p>
        This assignment will be completed <a href="groups">in groups</a>.
	Your team will use the <tt>git(1)</tt>
        revision control system to track progress and collaborate.  Please
        see <a href="git.html">this page</a> for details on setting up
        your shared repository.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please note that all members of the team are expected to
        participate and need to contribute <em>in equal parts</em>.  Your git
        commit log will be part of the final submission, and your
        ability to collaborate with your team mates a factor in your grade.  Commit early,
        commit often, communicate regularly.
        Stronger team members have the responsibility to guide
        and mentor less advanced team members, <em>not</em> to
        write all the code themselves.  I expect
	your final README to include details about the
	collaboration and division of work: summarize
        what parts where completed by whom, how you
        collaborated, and how each of you contributed.
        </p>
	<h5>Additional considerations</h5>
	<p>
	Please carefully read <a
	href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945.html">RFC1945</a> to understand
	version 1.0 of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
	</p>
	<p>
	Please carefully read <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3875.html">RFC3875</a>
	to understand the Common Gateway Interface.
	</p>
	<p>
	Your program should behave as one would expect from a regular system
	daemon. That is, it should detach from the controlling terminal and
	run in the background, accept multiple simultaneous connections, not
	generate any messages on stdout unless in debugging mode etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	Your program does have to return normal HTTP/1.0 status codes as
	described in the RFC.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note: your web server only needs to accept relative URIs (see
        <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945#section-3.2.1">RFC1945,
        Section 3.2.1</a>); does not need to handle RFC1738 percent-encoded URIs;
        does not need to validate URIs against reserved character use.
	</p>
        <p>
        While your server speaks HTTP/1.0, it should <em>accept</em> HTTP/1.1
        requests and simply answer them as if they were HTTP/1.0 requests.
        This allows you to use a normal browser to access your server.
	</p>
	<h5>Supported Systems</H5>
        <p>
        As usual, your code must compile and run on our standard reference
        platform, NetBSD 10.x.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition, your code must <em>also</em> compile and run on these two
        systems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>linux.cs631.dotwtf.wtf</code> # SSH host key fingerprints are:
            <ul>
              <li><code>SHA256:H7StG3NkV4KM3VgFu6D52KvPZSQuOpBqZHWfNITp2qw</code></li>
              <li><code>SHA256:gJp2GfrUOzXsACwgv8gqc+TclUGFJp272q5x5arQ6Z4</code></li>
              <li><code>SHA256:hzSsTKR/LqnZyO8GNC9XvwHl11x1OJb8zBPXGjORtog</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><code>omnios.cs631.dotwtf.wtf</code> # SSH host key fingerprints are:
            <ul>
              <li><code>SHA256:rhmn5RgISE2wfCeoCHVIptTP73nhZRYgWxz+9xlA+7k</code></li>
              <li><code>SHA256:mSrbAcHpz9qPbVEcFhGT0qQ749MTru0GnPHQXw/7iWg</code></li>
              <li><code>SHA256:gDE9kckofygttcskxHpXO7K74+povSOGkIbmCvLW37E</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        To get access to these systems, please send a public SSH key ťo <a
        href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>.
        </p>
	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>You will submit a tar archive of all your files, including a
	Makefile.  The tar archive will be named "<em>user1-user2-user3</em>.tar",
	and extract into a directory named "<em>user1-user2-user3</em>", where
	<em>user1</em> etc. are the usernames of your
	group's members.
	</p>
	<p>
	You must submit a snapshot of your work in progress by 2025-11-24
	15:59:59.  By then, your program must be able to accept network
	connections, read data from the client and validate the
	request made.  This includes parsing the request method and
	protocol information as well as identifying supported client
	headers.  Failure to submit the snapshot will result in a 10%
	deduction from the final grade.
	</p>
        <p>
        The due date for this assignment is 2025-12-08 15:59:59.  Please
        attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
        email address to <a
        href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] group project">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
        with a subject of "[CS631] group project".
        </p>

	<p>Please note that there is no resubmission for this
	project.</p>
