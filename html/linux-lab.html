        <H2>CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Linux Lab</H2>

	<p>
	In this class, it is frequently useful to compare how different Unix(-like)
        systems differ in their behavior.  For this,
it's useful for you to have an account on the shared <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens-tech.edu</tt>
	systems. <b>It is your responsibility to get an account on these systems
	prior to the start of the class.</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	In order to get an account on
	<tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens-tech.edu</tt>, you need to:
	<ul>
	<li>go to <a href="https://sit.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1865/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=8231">https://sit.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1865/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=8231</a></li>
	<li>select 'Contact CS Dept' on the right</li>
	<li>fill in the request</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	Access to <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt> is via
	<tt>ssh(1)</tt>, using a load balancing mechanism that will drop
	you into any one of a handful of systems.  As noted on the
	course website, you are expected to be familiar with operating
	in this environment.
