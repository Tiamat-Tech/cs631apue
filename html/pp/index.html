	<hr>

<p> In order to better understand Unix systems, it's
best to actually <em>use</em> Unix systems.  One way
to do that is to practice using pipelines to
accomplish certain tasks, to get used to invoking the
common Unix tools, like <code>sed(1)</code>,
<code>grep(1)</code>, <code>awk(1)</code>,
<code>sort(1)</code>, <code>uniq(1)</code>,
<code>head(1)</code>, <code>tail(1)</code>, ...</p>

<p>So let's play a game of <em>Pipes Practice</em>,
inspired by the <a
href="https://punkx.org/unix-pipe-game/">UNIX Pipe
Card Game</a> and an <a
href="/615/scripting-exercise.html">exercise</a> I use
in <a href="/615/">CS615 - System
Administration</a>:</p>

<p>Let's suppose we have copy-pasta'd the <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/">IMDB Top 250
Movies</a> page into a plain text file.
Unfortunately, the formatting got all messed up, so
now the file looks like this:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
The Shawshank Redemption
1994
2h 22m

 (2.9M)

Marlon Brando in The Godfather (1972)

Christian Bale in The Dark Knight (2008)

[...]
</pre></blockquote></p>

<p>Each week, we'll pose a "challenge" to construct a
pipeline that uses this data file as input and that
should provide the requested output.  There are two
challenge modes:</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the shortest command or pipeline to produce the desired output.</li>
    <li>Find the weirdest, most creative, absurd, or simply most convoluted command or pipeline to produce the desired output.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>Note: you may <em>not</em> install additional
software; all challenges must be completed using only
commands shipped with NetBSD in the default
installation.</p>

<p>For the second challenge, no command may be invoked
more than once (e.g., "<code>cat | cat | cat</code>" or
"<code>base64 | base64 -d</code>" is <em>not</em>
allowed).</p>

<p>I will post the weekly challenge in Slack, and upon
resolution update this page with the winning
submissions.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, the data file to use as
input for all challenges is <a href="imdb-top250">this
file</a>.</p>

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>Let's start easy.  This week's challenge is to find
the command(s) to:</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>print the first line</li>
    <li>print the last line</li>
    <li>print the second line</li>
    <li>print the second to last line</li>
  </ul>
